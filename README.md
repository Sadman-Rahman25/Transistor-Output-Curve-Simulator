# Transistor-Output-Curve-Simulator
Simulates and analyzes the output characteristics of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) using LTspice. Shows collector current versus collector-emitter voltage at different base currents, helping understand active region behavior. Developed for Electronic Devices course CSE251.
